Partial Kasada Reverse (python)

I decided to release my reverse for Kasada's *X-KSPDK-CT* Header cuz I was bored and I need github stars. All you need to do is fetch the *X-KPSDK-CD* value by sending a request to the */fp?x-kpsdk-v=j-0.0.0* endpoint with the *KP_UIDZ_1-ssn* cookie and parse. I might update this repo with the full reverse later on if I get bored again but for now im gonna leave it at this since it's all you should need for KASADA.

Note: I would also like to mention this is my first reverse I was able to "complete" and it was actually pretty fun debugging believe it or not i'm not sure why i enjoyed reversing this but I did
